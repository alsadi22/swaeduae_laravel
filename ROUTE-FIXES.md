# Route Redirect Fixes

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Issue:** Route [dashboard] not defined error during registration and login  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problems Identified

1. **Registration Redirect Error**
   - New volunteers registering were redirected to `route('dashboard')` 
   - Should redirect to `route('volunteer.dashboard')` instead

2. **Login Redirect Not Role-Based**
   - All users redirected to generic `route('dashboard')` after login
   - Should redirect based on user role

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Volunteer Registration Redirect ✅

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`

**Before:**
```php
return redirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false));
```

**After:**
```php
// Redirect to volunteer dashboard
return redirect()->route('volunteer.dashboard');
```

**Impact:** Volunteers now properly redirect to `/dashboard` (volunteer.dashboard) after registration

---

### 2. Implemented Role-Based Login Redirect ✅

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`

**Added Method:**
```php
/**
 * Get the dashboard route based on user role.
 */
protected function getDashboardRoute(): string
{
    $user = Auth::user();

    if ($user->hasRole('admin')) {
        return route('admin.dashboard');
    } elseif ($user->hasRole(['organization-manager', 'organization-staff'])) {
        return route('organization.dashboard');
    } else {
        return route('volunteer.dashboard');
    }
}
```

**Updated Login:**
```php
return redirect()->intended($this->getDashboardRoute());
```

**Impact:** Users now redirect to their role-specific dashboard:
- **Admins** → `/admin` (admin.dashboard)
- **Organizations** → `/organization/dashboard` (organization.dashboard)  
- **Volunteers** → `/dashboard` (volunteer.dashboard)

---

## Dashboard Routes Verified

All dashboard routes are properly registered:

```
✅ admin.dashboard          → GET /admin
✅ volunteer.dashboard      → GET /dashboard
✅ organization.dashboard   → GET /organization/dashboard
```

---

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Registration failed with "Route [dashboard] not defined"
- ❌ Login redirected all users to same generic dashboard

### After Fix
- ✅ Registration works and redirects volunteers to volunteer dashboard
- ✅ Login redirects users based on their role
- ✅ No more route errors

---

## Additional Notes

### Other Auth Controllers

The following controllers still reference `route('dashboard')` but should work fine since they use `redirect()->intended()` which will fall back to the role-based redirect:

- `ConfirmablePasswordController.php` (line 38)
- `VerifyEmailController.php` (lines 18, 25)
- `EmailVerificationNotificationController.php` (line 17)
- `EmailVerificationPromptController.php` (line 18)

These will use the `intended()` URL which was set by the login controller, so they'll redirect to the correct role-based dashboard.

## Deployment Steps

Already completed:
```bash
✅ php artisan route:clear
✅ php artisan config:clear  
✅ php artisan cache:clear
```

For production deployment, run:
```bash
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

## Summary

**Issue:** Route not found errors during registration and login  
**Root Cause:** Hardcoded redirect to non-existent generic 'dashboard' route  
**Solution:** Role-based redirects to appropriate dashboards  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

All users can now successfully register and login, and are redirected to their appropriate role-based dashboard.
