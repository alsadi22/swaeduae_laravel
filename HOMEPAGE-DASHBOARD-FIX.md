# Homepage Dashboard Route Fix

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Error:** Route [dashboard] not defined on homepage  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

When accessing the homepage (https://swaeduae.ae/), authenticated users saw the error:
```
Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\RouteNotFoundException
Route [dashboard] not defined.
```

This occurred because `welcome.blade.php` was trying to link to a non-existent generic `dashboard` route.

### Error Location
- **File:** `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
- **Lines:** 44, 79, 109, 455 (4 instances)

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated All Dashboard Links ✅

Replaced hardcoded `route('dashboard')` with **role-based logic**:

```php
@auth
    @php
        $dashboardRoute = auth()->user()->hasRole('admin') 
            ? route('admin.dashboard') 
            : (auth()->user()->hasRole(['organization-manager', 'organization-staff']) 
                ? route('organization.dashboard') 
                : route('volunteer.dashboard'));
    @endphp
    <a href="{{ $dashboardRoute }}">Dashboard</a>
@else
    <!-- Guest links -->
@endauth
```

### 2. Locations Fixed

✅ **Desktop Navigation** (line 44) - Top navigation bar  
✅ **Mobile Navigation** (line 79) - Mobile menu  
✅ **Hero Section CTA** (line 109) - "Go to Dashboard" button  
✅ **Organizations Section** (line 455) - "View All Organizations" button

---

## How It Works

The fix dynamically determines which dashboard to show based on user role:

| User Role | Dashboard Route | URL |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Admin** | `admin.dashboard` | `/admin` |
| **Organization Manager** | `organization.dashboard` | `/organization/dashboard` |
| **Organization Staff** | `organization.dashboard` | `/organization/dashboard` |
| **Volunteer** | `volunteer.dashboard` | `/dashboard` |
| **Guest** (not authenticated) | Shows registration links | N/A |

## Testing

### Before Fix
```bash
# Visit homepage as authenticated user
❌ Error: Route [dashboard] not defined
❌ 500 Internal Server Error
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Visit homepage as Admin
✅ "Dashboard" link → /admin

# Visit homepage as Organization Manager
✅ "Dashboard" link → /organization/dashboard

# Visit homepage as Volunteer
✅ "Dashboard" link → /dashboard

# Visit homepage as Guest
✅ Shows "Start Volunteering" and "Organizations Join Here" buttons
```

## Related Fixes

This is part of a series of dashboard route fixes:

1. ✅ **Registration Redirect** - `RegisteredUserController.php`
2. ✅ **Login Redirect** - `AuthenticatedSessionController.php`  
3. ✅ **Generic Dashboard Route** - `routes/web.php`
4. ✅ **Homepage Links** - `welcome.blade.php` (this fix)

All dashboard references now use role-based routing.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

### For Developers

When adding dashboard links in views, always use role-based logic:

```php
@auth
    @php
        $dashboardRoute = auth()->user()->hasRole('admin') 
            ? route('admin.dashboard') 
            : (auth()->user()->hasRole(['organization-manager', 'organization-staff']) 
                ? route('organization.dashboard') 
                : route('volunteer.dashboard'));
    @endphp
    <a href="{{ $dashboardRoute }}">Dashboard</a>
@endauth
```

**❌ DON'T:**
```php
<a href="{{ route('dashboard') }}">Dashboard</a>
```

**✅ DO:**
```php
<!-- Use role-based routing -->
@php $dashboardRoute = /* role check */ @endphp
<a href="{{ $dashboardRoute }}">Dashboard</a>
```

### Search for Issues

Find any remaining hardcoded dashboard routes:

```bash
grep -r "route('dashboard')" resources/views/
```

## Alternative: Helper Function

For cleaner code, consider creating a helper function:

**app/Helpers/DashboardHelper.php:**
```php
<?php

if (!function_exists('get_dashboard_route')) {
    function get_dashboard_route() {
        if (!auth()->check()) {
            return route('login');
        }
        
        $user = auth()->user();
        
        if ($user->hasRole('admin')) {
            return route('admin.dashboard');
        } elseif ($user->hasRole(['organization-manager', 'organization-staff'])) {
            return route('organization.dashboard');
        } else {
            return route('volunteer.dashboard');
        }
    }
}
```

**Usage in Blade:**
```php
<a href="{{ get_dashboard_route() }}">Dashboard</a>
```
